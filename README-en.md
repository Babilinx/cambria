# Cambria Linux

Cambria Linux is a fast and easy installer for Gentoo.
The project aims to be a descendant of [Orchid Linux](https://github.com/orchid-linux/orchid/). The idea behind the project was picked up from Orchid.

Our idea is the same as Orchid's one: we want to deliver a fast and efficient install of Gentoo, with a preinstalled DE, some homemade tools and some apps corresponding to the user's needs.

Cambria's caracteristics:

- In the same way Orchid did, we don't define us as a whole OS but more as a Gentoo "rice".

- We mostly focus on advanced users, even if our tools are here to make the install and maintenance of the distro easier than Gentoo.

- **All** Gentoo packages are available.

- By default, the kernel is the `gentoo-kernel-bin`, which follows the LTS channel of Linux. Other kernels will be proposed after the install.

- We deliver the GNOME and KDE desktop environments. Other DEs will probably be added in the future.
